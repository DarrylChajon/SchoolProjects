Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Darryl Chajon and this repository consists of some of the projects and programs that I have created throughout my school career. I have experience creating programs in many languages like Java, C, SQL, Python, and Assembly Language. I have created much more programs than the ones I placed in here, but the ones you see here are some of my more significant and cohesive projects. Thank you for visiting!
